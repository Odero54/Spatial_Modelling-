Urban walkability is the extent to which an environment, especially a built environment, allows 
walking and is pedestrian-friendly. Walkable neighborhoods are great for health, happiness and 
economic growth. This research analyses disparities in walking conditions at a 5 km buffer in 
Karura forest neighborhoods, the main forest located at the heart of Nairobi City in Kenya. This 
study examines factors such as the green space index, population density, temperature, building 
density, street intersection density, elevation, and accessibility to social amenities to estimate the 
quality of walking in urban green spaces. This work predicts the best quality walking locations 
based on the factors mentioned above by developing a machine learning (ML) pipeline, utilizing 
four algorithms, to assess which ML algorithm performs better in predicting the best walkable 
locations. This study generated a walkability proxy target variable using a multi-criteria decision 
(MCDA) analysis technique using the technique of preference by similarity to ideal solution 
(TOPSIS) method. The study found that random forest was the best classifier among the four ML 
algorithms, followed by decision tree, logistic regression, and gradient boosting, with accuracies 
of 93.4%, 91,3%, 91.3%, and 89.1%, respectively. Therefore, for the model development, a 
random forest was selected and finally performed with an accuracy of 97.8%. The model found 
that urban densities (population, buildings, and street intersection density) were important 
variables in estimating the best walkable locations. The results provide insights that could be 
used to develop infrastructure to promote walkability around green spaces. A well-developed city 
without pedestrians is not an active social place with a high level of communication. This causes 
a loss in the vitality and livability of an area. Moreover, a built environment without any walking 
infrastructure cannot be grouped among successful smart cities.
